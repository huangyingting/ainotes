In terms of planning, the agent breaks down large tasks into smaller subgoals and can reflect on past actions to improve future results. The agent also utilizes short-term and long-term memory to learn and retain information. Additionally, the agent can call external APIs for additional information. The design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning, and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave based on past experience and interact with other agents.\\n\",\n",
