    "## Character Splitting\n",
    "Character splitting is the most basic form of splitting up your text. It is the process of simply dividing your text into N-character sized chunks regardless of their content or form.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method isn't recommended for any applications - but it's a great starting point for us to understand the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pros:** Easy & Simple\n",
    "* **Cons:** Very rigid and doesn't take into account the structure of your text\n",
    "\n",
    "Concepts to know:\n",
    "* **Chunk Size** - The number of characters you would like in your chunks. 50, 100, 100,000, etc.\n",
    "* **Chunk Overlap** - The amount you would like your sequential chunks to overlap. This is to try to avoid cutting a single piece of context into multiple pieces. This will create duplicate data across chunks."
