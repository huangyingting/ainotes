      "AI agents hold much promise, with some saying they will revolutionize the workplace itself. \n",
      "But they can be a bit concept-y, and enterprises don’t always know where to begin. \n",
      "One-year-old startup CrewAI has quickly become one of the most popular AI agent frameworks — it’s used by the likes of AI pioneer Andrew Ng, among many other leading companies — as it simplifies the building and deployment of multi-agent systems. \n",
      "Today, the company is launching its first — and highly-anticipated — product to market, CrewAI Enterprise. The platform, which has been in beta for some months, enables users to build, deploy and iterate multi-agent “crews.” The company is also announcing an $18 million funding round. \n",
      "CrewAI founder and CEO João Moura called the opportunity for AI agents “immense.” \n",
      "“The AI agent is basically right now an LLM that doesn’t need to be part of conversations,” he told VentureBeat. “Instead of a conversation, you give it a task, and it has the agency to autonomously decide what to do and when to do it.”\n",
      "‘The simpler the better,’ open-source critical\n",
      "According to Markets and Markets, the AI agent industry will grow dramatically in the next five years, from $5 billion this year to nearly $50 billion by 2030. Capgemini reports that 10% of large enterprises are already using AI agents, more than half plan to use them in the next year and 82% will adopt them within the next three years. \n",
      "“Agents are the big thing everyone’s talking about right now,”said Moura. “The genie is not going back into the bottle. People want this to happen.”\n",
      "CrewAI, which was just founded in 2023, has already established itself as one of the most popular agent frameworks, competing with the likes of Langraph and Autogen. Moura noted that enterprises are more and more quickly moving from AI agent conception to use cases. \n",
      "“What we’re noticing is that companies are graduating way faster than we expected,” he said. \n",
      "The company’s new platform is built on top of its popular open-source framework and enables organizations to build crews of AI agents using any large language model (LLM) or cloud platform. Users can plan and build multi-agent systems; securely deploy those agents into a production environment with custom levels of access and control; and iterate and track ROI with testing and training tools. \n",
      "When getting started with AI agents, “the simpler the better,” said Moura. That’s what sets CrewAI apart, he said; they also have “doubled down” on educating people. \n",
      "“It’s a brand new category and market,” he said. “People are trying to understand how they should go about this, they want to be educated.” He noted of other competing projects, “it’s almost like they’re trying to make it complex on purpose.”\n",
      "CrewAI also has significant open-source traction. The company has a “very opinionated” view on how agents work. Open-source is an instrumental part of how the world builds software, Moura noted and is an “amazing distribution channel.”\n",
      "“The world runs on open-source, every software out there uses open-source libraries,” he said. “We don’t want to be in a world where all models are closed source, you don’t know what’s going on, you’re locked in with all these vendors.”\n",
      "Use cases from internal processes to marketing\n",
      "Moura pointed to a “big array of use cases” for agentic AI overall and called CrewAI’s offering “such a cross vertical product.”\n",
      "The most common use cases are around internal automations, marketing and coding, he noted. Agents can perform research, summarization and reporting, and can also help with legal analysis. \n",
      "For instance, one Fortune 500 customer with consumer-facing products was looking to update legacy projects and apps (including Java and SAP). They were able to build agents that can update and test code themselves before passing them off for final review by a human engineer. They are saving hundreds of thousands of dollars as a result (by their own estimate), said Moura. \n",
      "“Marketing’s another interesting one,” he noted. Agents can develop leads by interacting with  large, instant sources of information. Or, in the case of real estate companies, agents can monitor markets, produce leads and advise agents on buy-or-rent scenarios. \n",
      "Moura pointed to a big beverage company that used CrewAI to build agents that handle internal requests from a portal accessible by thousands of employees. A series of very specific rules need to be reviewed before internal requests can be approved, Moura explained; agents understand and review those rules, reply to requests (whether they were approved or not or if more info is needed). Robotic process automation (RPA) systems then take over to port stored information into the company’s database. \n",
      "Getting even more complex, Moura said CrewAI’s platform has been used by a big media company that fine-tuned models to act like movie directors: They can cut frames and add subtitles and music, then automatically push out to social media. \n",
      "“People are always pushing the cutting edge,” said Moura.\n",
      "Millions of agents, significant traction among Fortune 500\n",
      "CrewAI’s open-source platform executes 10 million-plus agents a month, and the company claims it is already being used by nearly half of the Fortune 500. It signed its first 150 beta enterprise customers in less than six months. \n",
      "“I gotta say it has been insane. I think we’re one of the fastest-growing projects out there,” said Moura. “It’s very intense and very humbling.”\n",
      "Crew AI’s inception round was led by boldstart ventures, and its series A was led by Insight Partners. Additional funding comes from Blitzscaling Ventures, Craft Ventures, Earl Grey Capital and several top angels including Ng and Dharmesh Shah, co-founder and CTO of HubSpot. \n",
      "Ng noted in a statement: “CrewAI makes it easy and fast to develop both simple and complex multi-agent AI workflows. Its powerful orchestration features for enterprises — including memory and self-healing — help businesses go well beyond traditional automation.”\n",

      "SAN FRANCISCO and SÃO PAULO, Oct. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CrewAI, a leading multi-agent platform, today announced $18 million in total funding that included an inception round led by boldstart ventures and a Series A led by global software investor Insight Partners. Additional investors include Blitzscaling Ventures, Craft Ventures, Earl Grey Capital, and several top angels in AI including Andrew Ng, a globally recognized voice in AI, and Dharmesh Shah, co-founder and CTO of HubSpot.  CrewAI’s open-source offering executes 10 million+ agents per month and is already used by nearly half of the Fortune 500. Building on the success of its open-source framework and in response to user demand, the company also launched CrewAI Enterprise, making it easier than ever for large organizations to quickly build, monitor, and iterate on complex AI agents with high-quality results. The company signed its first 150 beta enterprise customers in less than six months. More than 65% of companies are now using generative AI but almost all of them still express significant concerns about results accuracy and data security. These challenges are holding back the full potential of large language models (LLMs) for the enterprise. This is especially true for the automation of complex tasks in areas like marketing, accounting, and finance. Companies have not been able to use robotic process automation (RPA) for these use cases due to its rigid, deterministic approach, high implementation costs, brittleness, and inability to self-heal.  Developers in more than 150 countries are now using CrewAI to automate work processes and build AI-agent native features and applications. CrewAI is helping companies realize the enormous potential of LLMs by enabling AI agents to perform complex tasks that leverage LLMs in simple and complex workflows. CrewAI offers a range of advanced new features including self-iteration, performance evaluation, persistent memory, and a wide range of new agent collaboration structures. Enterprises are moving fast to adopt agents that deliver resultsThe AI agent market is projected to grow explosively from $5 billion this year to nearly $50 billion by 2030. According to a recent Capgemini survey, 10% of large enterprise organizations already use AI agents, more than half plan to use them in the next year, and 82% will integrate them within the next three years.  “Agents are the key to unlocking AI’s potential and will completely redesign the way companies deliver products. RPA and LLMs alone can’t get you there. Savvy organizations around the world are already deploying multi-agentic applications to help run an entire business while moving fast,” said João Moura, founder and CEO of CrewAI. “We are seeing impact firsthand; in less than one year of launching CrewAI, we signed our first 150 beta enterprise customers. We are seeing 100,000 groups of multi-agent executions per day across hundreds of different use cases. We have made it easy for teams to build groups of AI agents to perform tasks using any LLM, integrate with more than a thousand different applications, and to do so in a way that protects their data privacy.” CrewAI Enterprise for deploying fast complex AI workloads that drive business valueAfter a successful private beta, CrewAI is now launching its Enterprise Cloud offering, a universal platform that allows organizations to enable their teams to build crews of AI agents using any LLM or cloud platform – tailored to their unique, complex workloads – to achieve high-quality results. Built on top of CrewAI’s popular open-source framework, CrewAI Enterprise enables fast iterations by also offering templates, access to extensive VIP support, and built-in security. CrewAI Enterprise enables organizations to: Plan & Build: Use either CrewAI’s framework or Crew Studio to easily build even the most complex multi-agents systems.Deploy & Monitor: Bring these multi-agents automations into a production environment in a secure way with proper levels of access and control.Assess & Iterate: Track ROI by using testing and training tools to constantly improve the efficiency and results quality – ensuring a fast track to value. The new CrewAI Enterprise platform enables teams of all sizes to build, deploy, and iterate multi-agent “crews.” These AI agent crews can be used to automate work processes and power new AI-agent native features and applications. During the beta, CrewAI saw companies build crews for hundreds of different use cases.

Supporting Quotes\"The widespread adoption of LLMs in the enterprise is creating an enormous opportunity for new revenue streams and cost reduction. The catalyst for this will be AI multi-agent platforms. CrewAI is one of the early leaders in this exciting space and Insight Partners is thrilled to be an investor.
